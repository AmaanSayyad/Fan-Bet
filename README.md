FanBet combines the power of AI Generative Content (AIGC) and blockchain technology to create an immersive, fan-focused platform that empowers sports enthusiasts to connect, engage, and share content like never before.

## Problem Statement

The sports industry faces major challenges in engaging long-term fans, creating value for content, and building meaningful digital-to-physical connections. Current platforms often lack true community ownership and provide limited opportunities for fans to participate actively. FanBet solves these challenges by fostering an inclusive, fan-owned ecosystem where social interaction and content creation are rewarded.
